- 👋 Hi, I’m Raymundo
- 👀 I’m interested in developing backend, front-end and, above all, mobile apps. My current job is backend but I'm starting with front-end and android.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular and Android.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any backend app using Spring Boot would be great.
- 📫 How to reach me: send an e-mail to jacksmanchan@msn.com and wait a little for my answer. I'm busy but I will respond as soon as I read your mail.
